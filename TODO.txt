BUG: Poll implementation only works with one data structure.

BUG: Poll parsing fails for some calls to poll due to posix-omni-parser

BUG: Posix omni parser doesn't return stuff in comments at end of line (poll,
select)

Select vs. Poll
Select used a bitmask rather than an array of structures to track file
descriptors. Select is more commonly implemented but the nature of a bitmask
means that there are a limited number of file descriptors that can be tracked.
It has one advantage over poll: Early versions of poll didn't allow you to set a
structure's file descriptor to -1 to have it ignored meaning that if you no
longer care about a file descriptor you would have to rebuild the array.
Presumably it will be easier to un-track a file descriptor with select.

Send-like calls -> always assume they succeeded and return the expected number
of bytes from the trace.

Write-like system calls:
write
sendmsg
sendmmsg
sendto
send

Read-like system calls:
read
recvmsg
recvmmsg
receivefrom
recv
